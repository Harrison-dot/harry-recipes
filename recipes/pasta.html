        <h3> <b>Description</b> </h3>
        <p>
            Always, always salt the pasta water! It will affect the taste of the pasta, and the sauce you serve it with, so never miss out this step. <br>
            Avoid food waste and measure your portions. 75g of dried pasta per person is about right. If you are cooking for 4 people, you will need 300g of pasta. <br>
            Give your pasta plenty of room to cook so you want a large pan. <br>
            Cover your pan with a lid to help bring the water up to the boil more quickly, then remove the lid once the water is boiling or reduce the temperature slightly to stop it bubbling over. <br>
            Add the pasta to the water once it is boiling, never before, and cook without the lid. <br>  </p>

        <h4> <b> Steps to cook: </b></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Pick the basil leaves off the stalks and put to one side. Finely chop the stalks.</li>
            <li>Drain the spaghetti, reserving a mugful of cooking water, then transfer it to the pan of sauce and stir well. Add a splash of pasta cooking water to loosen, if needed, then taste and season to perfection.</li>
            <li>Divide the pasta between bowls, or put it on the table in a large serving dish and let everyone help themselves.</li>
        </ol>
